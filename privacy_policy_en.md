Counter Simple is a simple counters app that works without accounts. This policy explains what data the app processes, for what purposes, and your control options.

## Quick summary
- We don’t ask for your name or email, and we don’t create accounts.
- Your counters and history are stored locally on your device.
- We use Google services (Firebase Analytics and AdMob) for statistics and ads.
- Purchases are processed via Google Play Billing; we don’t access payment data.
- You can disable notifications, personalized ads, and clear the app data.

## Information we collect

### App data (local)
- **Counters you create, values, and history**. Stored **only on your device** using local storage (Hive). We don’t sync this data to our own servers.

### Analytics and measurement
- **Usage events** (e.g., opening screens, exporting CSV, button taps), and some **user properties** such as language, whether you enabled notifications, and premium status.
- Tool: **Firebase Analytics**. We don’t record information that directly identifies you.
- Google privacy policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

### Advertising
- We show ads using **Google AdMob**. AdMob and its partners may process:
  - Advertising identifier, impression and click metrics, technical information (such as device model/version) and approximate IP address to prevent fraud and measure performance.
- You can disable ad personalization in your device’s Google settings.
- Learn more: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads

### In‑app purchases
- We use **Google Play Billing** for voluntary tips, removing ads, and enabling premium features.
- We only receive the **purchase status** and **product ID** to activate benefits in the app. We **do not receive** card or banking information.

### Notifications
- The app may request the **notifications** permission to deliver reminders. Notifications are scheduled **locally** and are not sent from servers.
- On Android, the app may use system permissions like: `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, and `VIBRATE`, strictly to show and reschedule reminders.

## How we use the information
- Operate the app and your counters.
- Measure feature usage and improve performance.
- Show and measure ads.
- Enable benefits from purchases (remove ads, premium).
- Send local reminders when you enable them.

## Legal bases
- **Consent**: notifications permission and ad personalization.
- **Legitimate interests**: basic analytics and anti‑fraud security for ads.

## Sharing of data
- With Google technology providers to deliver services: **Firebase Analytics**, **Google AdMob**, and **Google Play Billing**.
- We do not sell data or share it with third parties unrelated to providing the service.

## Storage and retention
- Your counters data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.
- Retention for analytics and ads follows Google’s policies.

## Your choices and controls
- **Clear app data**: System settings → Apps → Counter Simple → Storage → Clear data.
- **Notifications**: enable or disable them in the app and in system settings.
- **Personalized ads**: Device settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of personalization.
- **Export**: you can export your history to CSV; the file is saved locally.

## Security
- The app uses secure connections to Google services. We take reasonable measures to protect information, though no system is 100% secure.

## Children
- The app is **not directed** to children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child has provided data, please contact us to address it.

## Changes
- We may update this policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements. We will publish the current version and its effective date.
